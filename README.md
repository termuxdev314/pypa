# pypa

pypa is a tool written in Bash that allows you to create Python modules without much effort. It creates the basic folder structure of a working Python module as required by PyPi.org. Especially beginners or those who are creating their first module often have difficulties creating a running module that is imported correctly. The tool helps to create the structure and get the module running. This program has the following features:
1. Creates the basic structure
2. Adds submodules and creates the __init__.py directly
3. When the module is ready, the module is initialized using the "init" command. A basic setup.py is added and the main __init__.py is created
4. The build and upload is integrated
